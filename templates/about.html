            <h2>ver 1.0 beta - barebones without fancy design.</h2>
        
            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <h2>Nati Aker, a programmer, a Magic player and foils lover.</h2>
            <h2>I'll be honest - sticking real stickers on real cards is stinky!</h2>
            <h2>Carring around your sticker sheets, choosing ten and then three, then pulling the stickers and sticking on cards, and returning them to the sticker sheet after use... and the glue is so weak so it just falls off...</h2>
            <h2>Well, that's just a lot of work.</h2>
            <h2>This little project is made in order to help you streamline the whole process. No stickers needed, no paper, no hussle. Just your phone!</h2>
            <h3>I would love any kind of feedback!</h3>
